Subject: Request for Removal of Credentials from GitHub

Dear Mohammad Omer,

I hope you are doing well.

We recently noticed that some credentials related to my company (SHBFinance) have been inadvertently included in the code uploaded to GitHub under your repository. To ensure security and prevent any potential risks, we kindly ask you to remove all credentials from the repository or change my company domain (SHBFinance) to anything.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,
